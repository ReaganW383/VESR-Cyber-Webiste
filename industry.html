                    <h2>What is my role at PlayStation?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">
                        As a software developer, I design, develop, and maintain software for PlayStations
                        <br> consoles, services, and apps which can range from upkeeping system software to
                        <br> creating game development tools for cloud infrastructure and mobile applications.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ethical Issues?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:right;">
                        <li>Some ethical issues that could arise with being a software developer is in game design and user experience
                        <br> more noteably with addictive design styles that can manipulate players and monetization.</li>
                         
                        <li>Another example of this is in Data and privacy design through Data collection and use 
                            <br> in that developers must ensure consent is obtained and that data is obtained securely
                            <br> to prevent breaches
                        </li>

                            <li>Confidentiality: PlayStation must ethically protect the vast amount of personal information
                                <br> it holds, including names, addresses, and purchase history.
                            </li>

                            <li>Encrytion v.s. security: Even if credit card data is encryted, other personally identifiable 
                                <br> information (PII) can still be exposed, creating ethical questions about the overall 
                                <br>effectiveness of security measures.
                            </li>
